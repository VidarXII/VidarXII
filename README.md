## Hi there 
When I’m not working on passing my B.Tech courses, and trying not to die from lack of sleep I'm working on maths, PINN related projects and deep learning in general

I’m currently learning CFD (computational fluid dynamics) and real analysis, apart from brushing up my basics on deep learning and machine learning in general.

I’m looking to collaborate on anything that involves a ton of math, be it game theory, machine learning theory, control systems or anything new and interesting

Ask me about 70s rock recommendations or my spotify playlist (hint: I love Wish you were Here)

How to reach me: nishant_p@me.iitr.ac.in
also you could just listen around for a very clumsy person, its probably me

Pronouns: He/Him

Fun fact: I don't use ChatGPT while doing anything creative, so I am 100% responsible for your mind twisting reading all this
